Added Examples/areaCALC.py by Nick Christogiannis.

this simple program calculates the area of very simple shapes(Has to be a very simple picture cause Canny might not work), and the percentages of each color in a picture.

at the end it gives us a ratio of the areas of the 2 pictures it takes as input.


Requirements:
	matplotlib
	Opencv --(cv2)
	module extcolors(I use pycharm so I install everything through the IDE)



The program takes 2 pictures as arguments from the code **NOT** as command line arguments.
